Boder was a former faculty member and head of the Department of Psychology and Philosophy at Chicago’s Lewis Institute (one of Illinois Tech’s predecessor colleges), and researcher of displaced persons later known as Holocaust survivors. In 1946 Boder traveled from Illinois Tech to Eastern Europe, taking with him a 50-pound wire recorder and 200 spools of carbon steel wire on which he recorded 119 interviews with individuals. These interviews provide the first and only known audio record of this important part of history. His 1949 book, <em>I Did Not Interview the Dead</em>, captures eight of these stories. Materials from Boder’s Voices of the Holocaust project were placed on permanent loan to the Illinois Holocaust Museum, which opened in Skokie in 2009, and the United States Holocaust Museum has since re-interviewed survivors.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="grid-x grid-margin-x"><div class="cell medium-4"><div data-langcode="en" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="78837baa-d2b5-44a3-8c4e-a5938dded97d" data-embed-button="ohou_media_embed" data-entity-embed-display="entity_reference:media_thumbnail" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_url_target&quot;:0,&quot;image_style&quot;:&quot;width_260&quot;,&quot;image_link&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" class="embedded-entity">  <img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/styles/width_260/public/2019-11/Robert_Pete_Bragg_II.jpg?itok=zlpldKvt" width="260" height="189" alt="Robert H. “Pete” Bragg II">

Using observations along with a computer-modeling technique, she surmised that a unique chemical reaction was occurring on the surfaces of clouds in the lower Antarctic stratosphere, contributing to the destruction of the protective ozone layer in that part of the world. In 1986 she led a team to Antarctica to get direct measurements to test all the possibilities; these measurements supported her hypothesis that manmade chlorofluorocarbons largely drove the reaction. This work played an important role in legislation designed to reduce the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. Solomon, a native Chicagoan, expanded her research to include climate change and is considered one of the world’s leading experts in the field. A recipient of the President’s National Medal of Science in 1999, she is now Ellen Swallow Richards Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
